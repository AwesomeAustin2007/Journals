We had to keep re-uploading the code to the board for every change we made, it took a while of adjusting where the text would display but we got it
We started out trying to make a timer, once the timer hit zero we wanted it to play a noise and display text.
We did use some methods to make shorter code. It helped out with making the coding process go by faster so that we had more time to focus more on the appearence of our box.
