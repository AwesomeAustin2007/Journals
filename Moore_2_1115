A string in java is a sequence of characters.
An integer is a whole number that completes in itself.
A method is a set of code which is given a name that can be called at any point in a program.
Methods are used for if you are using the same thing, like the same name or word over again and you dont feel like typing it in. Mainly from my pov they are used for a shortcut in code.
